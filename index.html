        <div class="about-content">
        <p>"I am a self-taught (aspiring) developer who loves building things with code.</p>
        <p>I first became enthralled with programming in early 2022. I was auditing diffirent websites for SEO purpose for my job as a SEO Specialist where I came across so many cool, beautiful websites, web apps with great UX/UI designs, and I was curious to know what behind all of that.</p>
        <p>So I looked it up on the Internet and I started learning. Specifically, I learned web development, as I had things I wanted to build for myself.</p>
        <p>After a few months of self-teaching, I knew this was what I wanted to do for my career. So, I signed up for a coding bootcamp and put my heart and soul into it. I was coding every day, late into the night, and on weekends. Until I was ready to be unleashed on production code.</p>
        <p>Through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" class="learning">freeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://scrimba.com/allcourses" target="_blank" class="learning">Scrimba</a>, I have begun to explore the fundamentals of web architecture, structure, and development. Because I enjoy solving problems and being creative, becoming a front-end developer was an easy choice to make.</p>
        <p>I'm now seeking a full-time role where I can contribute my skills both in coding and business to help a company achieve their goals."</p>
